**Aether Particles** is an interactive web experiment that combines WebGL rendering with Computer Vision. It generates a morphing 3D particle system (15,000+ points) that responds in real-time to your hand gestures via the webcam.

> **Note:** This project runs entirely in the browser using Vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, and Google MediaPipe. No backend is required.

## 🌟 Features

* **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect skeletal landmarks directly in the browser.
* **Gesture Control:**
    * **Rotate:** Move your hand around the screen to rotate the 3D model.
    * **Scale:** Pinch your thumb and index finger to scale the model size.
    * **Explode/Implode:** Move your hand closer to or further from the camera to scatter the particles or pull them tight.
* **Shape Morphing:** Seamlessly transition between mathematical 3D shapes:
    * 🌐 Sphere
    * ❤️ Heart
    * 🪐 Saturn (with rings)
    * 🌸 3D Flower/Rose Curve
* **Dynamic Visuals:** 15,000 individual particles with additive blending and dynamic coloring.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern overlay built with Tailwind CSS.

## 🎮 How to Use

1.  Allow **Camera Access** when prompted.
2.  Wait for the status indicator to turn **Green** ("Tracking Active").
3.  Use your hand to control the particles:

| Gesture | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hand Position** | Controls the X/Y **Rotation** of the object. |
| **Pinch (Thumb + Index)** | Controls the **Scale/Zoom** of the particles. |
| **Distance (Hand Size)** | Controls the **Entropy/Spread**. Move hand away to explode, closer to condense. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Because this project accesses the Webcam and loads ES modules via CDN, **it must be served via a local web server** (HTTPS or localhost). It will not work if you simply double-click the `.html` file (`file://` protocol) due to browser security restrictions.

### Installation & Running



1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/aether-particles.git](https://github.com/yourusername/aether-particles.git)

    cd aether-particles

    ```



2.  **Run the file:**

    Because this project requires access to the webcam, it is best run on a local server rather than opening the file directly (to avoid CORS policies).



    * **VS Code Users:** Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

    * **Python Users:**

        ```bash

        # Python 3

        python -m http.server 8000

        ```

    * **Node Users:**

        ```bash

        npx serve

        ```



3.  **Open in Browser:**

    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by your server). Allow camera permissions when prompted.






## 📂 Project Structure



The entire project is contained within `index.html` for simplicity:

* **CSS:** Embedded in `<style>` (plus Tailwind CDN).

* **Logic:** Embedded in `<script>`.

    * `init()`: Three.js setup.

    * `shapeTargets`: Mathematical formulas for particle positions.

    * `animate()`: The main render loop handling lerping and physics.

    * `MediaPipe`: Handling video input and landmark detection.
